            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Pizza sauce is typically made with plain tomato sauce or pureed tomatoes and tomato paste, causing it to be a thicker consistency than pasta sauce. The thicker sauce prevents the dough from getting too soggy while the pizza cooks. It also features a variety of spices such as oregano, Italian seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder, and sugar for a tangier flavor profile that perfectly complements the fats and oils in cheeses used for pizza. Pizza sauce is then spread in a thin layer on top of the pizza dough and cooked simultaneously with the dough and toppings, bringing all of the flavors together. Homemade variations may include cooking instructions for the sauce before placing it on the dough.
