# odin-recipes
A [simple recipe website](https://ketanpatil1.github.io/odin-recipes/) made while following [TheOdinProject's](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/) curriculum([lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes)).  
This was created a long time ago when I was starting to learn web development, so it's not well-made.
